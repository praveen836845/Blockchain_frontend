# Staking and Unstaking Application

## Overview
The SBTC Staking Protocol is a decentralized application that allows users to stake Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and receive SBTC tokens in return. Users can stake and unstake their WBTC, with the opportunity to earn rewards from staking within the blockchain. This project leverages smart contracts to manage the staking process, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.


## Features
- **WBTC Deposit**: Users can deposit their WBTC tokens to receive SBTC.
- **WBTC Staking**: Users can stake their SBTC tokens to receive rewards.
- **Unstaking**: Users can unstake their SBTC to receive their SBTC back.
- **Rewards**: Participants earn rewards based on the amount and duration of their staking.
- **Decentralized**: All transactions are executed on the blockchain, ensuring trust and transparency.

## How It Works
1. **Deposit**: Users deposit their WBTC tokens to receive SBTC tokens.
2. **Stake**: Users stake their SBTC tokens to participate in the staking process.
3. **Unstake**: Users can choose to unstake their SBTC tokens after Unbounding period(2 days).
4. **Rewards**: Users earn rewards based on the amount and duration of their staking.


## Smart Contract
The core functionality of the SBTC Staking Protocol is managed through a single smart contract that includes the following functions:

- **Deposit**: Allows users to deposit WBTC tokens into the staking contract.
- **Stake**: Handles the staking process.
- **Calculate Rewards**: Computes the rewards that users earn over time based on their staked SBTC.
- **Claim Rewards**: Enables users to claim the rewards they've accumulated.
- **Unstake**: Allows users to unstake their SBTC and withdraw their WBTC, including any earned rewards.
- **Withdraw**: Facilitates the withdrawal of WBTC after unstaking.

This smart contract ensures secure and transparent management of staking, rewards, and withdrawals, all within a single, streamlined codebase.

## Get Started
